| Full multi-agent crisis management system | Real-time monitoring & performance metrics |

### 🎯 Project Overview

**Enhanced Agentic AI System** is a sophisticated multi-agent autonomous incident management platform that demonstrates the power of intelligent model selection and routing. Built specifically for the **Mission Agent Possible** contest, this system showcases enterprise-grade AI capabilities with intelligent model routing, real-time observability, and comprehensive crisis management.

### 🏆 Contest Alignment

**Microsoft Mission Agent Possible 2025** - Mastering Model Selection for Effective Agents

**Mission**: AI strategist at Trey Marketing Inc. - Deploy intelligent agents to resolve critical product launch issues under time pressure.

### 🚀 Key Features

✅ **Multi-Model AI Agent Analytics Dashboard** - Real-time token usage, performance metrics  
✅ **TechShop E-commerce Integration** - Crisis management in action  
✅ **Specialized AI Agents** - Live system monitoring and incident resolution  
✅ **Azure OpenAI Integration** - Multiple models working together  

### 🎯 Technical Excellence

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for different aspects of crisis management
- **Intelligent Model Selection**: Dynamic routing between GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo based on task complexity
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live monitoring dashboard with token usage and performance metrics
- **Production Deployment**: Fully deployed on Azure App Service with CI/CD
- **Enterprise-Grade**: Built with observability, evaluation, and monitoring frameworks

### 📊 Solution to Contest Challenge

The system directly addresses the TreyLink Crisis scenario:

1. **Detect what went wrong**: Automated analysis of system logs and error patterns
2. **Determine how to fix it**: Intelligent recommendation engine with multiple resolution paths
3. **Execute under pressure**: Real-time crisis management with multi-agent coordination

### 🔧 Technology Stack

- **AI/ML**: Azure OpenAI, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, LangChain
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic
- **Deployment**: Azure App Service, Docker
- **Monitoring**: Custom observability framework with real-time analytics

### 📈 Why This Submission Stands Out

1. **Live Production System**: Fully deployed and accessible for immediate evaluation
2. **Model Selection Mastery**: Demonstrates intelligent routing between multiple AI models
3. **Real-World Application**: Solves actual enterprise crisis management scenarios
4. **Comprehensive Analytics**: Live dashboards showing system performance and model usage
5. **Enterprise Architecture**: Built with scalability, observability, and production-readiness in mind

### 🎓 Developer Background

- **Experience**: 16+ years as Senior Staff Software Architect
- **Current Role**: Blue Yonder (formerly Microsoft, Apple, JPMorgan, IBM)
- **Expertise**: Agentic AI Systems, Supply Chain Optimization, Enterprise Architecture
- **Education**: Master of Computer Science, Senior IEEE and ACM member
